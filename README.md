# WebScrapers-TwitterNoAPI
A webscraper that takes user input about a certain query (hashtag, username, or search term) and scrapes the platform for tweet data,<br>
without making use of the official Twitter API. <br>
Using the API is better but for the sole purpose of text scraping, this program is lighter and has no call limit like the API.
